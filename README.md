## Getting Started! 🚀

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

```
git clone otahina/PowerPoint-Generator-Python-Project
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```
PowerPoint-Generator-Python-Project
```

3. **Install the required Python packages. This project relies on several Python packages for its functionality**:


```
pip install flask flask_login flask_bcrypt flask_sqlalchemy python_dotenv python_pptx
```

4. **Run the application!**

```
python3 flaskapp.py
```
Make sure you set up the API key below first🙂

## Setup the Secret Key and OpenAI Key 🔑


1. The application uses a secret key for session management and an OpenAI key for the GPT-3.5 Turbo API.

You need to set these as environment variables in your terminal. On **Unix/Linux/macOS**, you can do this with the 'export' command:

```
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
export OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
export PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_key
```
Here's a brief description of each key and how to obtain them:

**SECRET_KEY**: 🔐This is used for web application security such as session management. You can create your own secure, random string for this.

**OPENAI_KEY**: 🤖This is required to access the OPENAI API. Although there's a limitation with the free version, it's sufficient for trying out this web application on your local machine. You can obtain this key by creating an account on the https://platform.openai.com.

**PEXELS_API_KEY**: 🏞️ This key is used for the free image search API provided by Pexels. It's very useful for adding creative images to your presentations. You can get this key by creating a free account on the https://www.pexels.com/api
After registering, the API key is automatically generated for you.

On **Windows**, you can do this with the 'set' command:

```
set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
set OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
set PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_key
```
⚠️ Note that these environment variables will only be set for the duration of the terminal session. If you close the terminal and open a new one, you will need to set them again.
